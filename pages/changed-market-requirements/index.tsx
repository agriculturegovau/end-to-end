      <strong>Purpose:</strong>
      provide streamlined and personalised interactions with services from one central place.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Context:</strong>
      Policy and importing country requirements are not always communicated to clients in a timely way. The
      communications can arrive via multiple channels, and the regulatory requirements can be difficult to understand.
    </p>
    <p>By designing a service that:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>responds to changes to an export business's circumstances in real-time</li>
      <li>proactively reaches provides guidance and support relevant to their situation,</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We can help people understand and more easily comply with changes in requirements in a timely, efficient and
      cost-effective way.
    </p>
