      <strong>Purpose:</strong> provide streamlined and personalised interactions with services from one central place.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Context:</strong> export businesses have to provide the same information to DAWE and other departments
      repeatedly. The evidence is often manual and not high quality.
    </p>

    <p>
      We can provide agricultural export services with information that has been verified and has a high-level of
      assurance around the provenance, to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>reduce time and effort required to verify that information</li>
      <li>improve processing time around compliance time, and</li>
      <li>reduce the need for audits and inaccurate reporting to government.</li>
    </ul>
  </IntroLayout>
